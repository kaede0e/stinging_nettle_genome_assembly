Original_HiC_hap1       Nettle_female_hifi_hifiasm_0.19.8_Q20reads.asm.hic.hap1.p_ctg.0.hic     Hi-C mapped to the contig-level assembly produced by Juicer+3d-dna pipeline. Original assembly generated with Hifiasm on the >Q20 HiFi reads + HiC reads.       05-14-2024      NA
Original_HiC_hap1_asm.0 Nettle_female_hifi_hifiasm_0.19.8_Q20reads.asm.hic.hap1.p_ctg.0.assembly        Auto-generated default assembly file by 3d-dna pipeline. No manual edits.       05-13-2024      NA
Hap1_asm.review.1       Nettle_female_hifi_hifiasm_0.19.8_Q20reads.asm.hic.hap1.p_ctg.0.review.1.assembly       .0.assembly was modified by obvious misassemblies without breaking any contigs. 13 chromosomes assigned but with extra contig in front. 05-16-2024      Round_1_hap1.reviewed.chr_assembled.fasta(NA)
Hap1_asm.review.2       Nettle_female_hifi_hifiasm_0.19.8_Q20reads.asm.hic.hap1.p_ctg.0.review.2.assembly       Post H1+H2 assessment, a few contigs were reoriented; one contig identified to be mis-assorted to H2 instead of H1 so that got fixed by putting the contig in the bin.  05-23-2024      Round_2_hap1.reviewed.chr_assembled.fasta
Hap1_asm.review.3       Nettle_female_hifi_hifiasm_0.19.8_Q20reads.asm.hic.hap1.p_ctg.0.review.3.assembly       Attempt to incorporate ONT data was done on review.2-->Round_2 assembly but no gaps were filled. So this file looked into the H1+H2.v2 alignment to fix a few spots without breaking contigs. H1 chr1 issue was fixed so now this has 13 chromosomes.  08-06-2024       Round_3_hap1.reviewed.chr_assembled.fasta

Not much obvious corrections were made.    08-06-2024      NA
Hap1_asm.review.3.2     Nettle_female_hifi_hifiasm_0.19.8_Q20reads.asm.hic.hap1.p_ctg.0.review.3.2.assembly     because I wasn't confident in SVs seen on the Round_3 data, I looked manually again on the review.3 and only corrected a few small contigs with obvious mistakes.       08-28-2024      Round_4_hap1.reviewed.chr_assembled.fasta
Hap1_asm.review.3.3     Nettle_female_hifi_hifiasm_0.19.8_Q20reads.asm.hic.hap1.p_ctg.0.review.3.3.assembly     based on SyRI INV tables, I checked the chr01 and chr02 and separately modified H1 assembly file in Juicebox (I inserted 400,000 bp contigs in the beginning of H1 so that should be added to all coordinates)  09-08-2024      NA

Hap1_asm.review.3.5     Nettle_female_hifi_hifiasm_0.19.8_Q20reads.asm.hic.hap1.p_ctg.0.review.3.5.assembly     based on SyRI INV tables, I checked the chr06,07,08,09. When in doublt, checked on H1+H2_v3 and verified SV.    09-10-2024     NA
Hap1_asm.review.3.6     Nettle_female_hifi_hifiasm_0.19.8_Q20reads.asm.hic.hap1.p_ctg.0.review.3.6.assembly     based on SyRI INV tables, I checked the chr10,11,12,13. When in doubt, check H1+H2_v3 map and verified SV.      09-10-2024     Round_5_hap1.reviewed.chr_assembled.fasta
H1_v1   Nettle_female_H1_v1_genome.chr.fa       This was the genome after Round_3 that got annotated for test.
Hap1_final_asm_v1       Nettle_female_H1_Round_5_syri_input_genome.fa   Chromosome names were reordered to match homology with H2; ordered by size of my assembly.      09-11-2024
Hap1_final_asm_v1_reordered     Nettle_female_H1_Round_5_chrname_reordered_genome.fa    Chr07 and 05 were flipped to align with the DToL genome.        09-12-2024      annotated with EDTA(IP) & BRAKER3(IP), RepeatOBserver(IP)

H1+H2_HiC       Nettle_female_asm.hic.hap1_hap2.chr.0.hic       After the review.1.assembly, H1+H2 fasta concatenated (both chr assigned but H1 with extra contig in front) again ran juicer+3d-dna pipeline.   05-19-2024      NA

H1+H2_HiC.2     Nettle_female_asm.hic.hap1_hap2.v2.chr.0.hic    Realized the first contig problem on H1 was still not fixed. After review.2 another improved H1+H2 created and re-did juicer+3d-dna pipeline.   05-27-2024      NA
H1+H2_HiC.2.asm.0       Nettle_female_asm.hic.hap1_hap2.v2.chr.0.assembly       Default assembly file from H1+H2.v2 - supposedly most clean alignment used in Anchorwave and minimap2 for further alignment.    05-27-2024      Nettle_female_asm.hic.hap1_hap2.chr.fa
